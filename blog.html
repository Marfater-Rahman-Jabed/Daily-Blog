            <h1><span class="text-primary">var</span></h1>
            <p>
                Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally
                scoped or function/locally scoped.

                The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable
                that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

                var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be
                accessed only within that function.
            </p>
            <h1><span class="text-warning">let</span></h1>
            <p>
                let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var
                declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.

                let is block scoped
                A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is
                a block.

                So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h1><span class="text-danger">const</span></h1>
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with
            let declarations.

            const declarations are block scoped
            Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

            const cannot be updated or re-declared
            This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be
            updated or re-declared.

                (2.) Difference between <span class="text-danger">Arrow function</span> & <span
                    class="text-warning">Regular function</span>
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Arrow function — also called fat arrow function — is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more
                concise syntax for a writing function expression.

                Following are the main differences:<br>
                Syntax<br>
                Arguments binding<br>
                Use of this keyword<br>
                Using a new keyword<br>
                No duplicate named parameters<br><br><br>
                1) Syntax: <br>
                A developer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow
                functions. <br><br>
                2) Arguments binding <br>
                Arrow functions do not have arguments binding.
                <br><br>
                3) Use of this keyword <br>
                unlike Regular functions, arrow function does not have their own "this" keyword.

                The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and
                is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function. <br><br>
                4) Using a new keyword <br>
                Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
                Regular functions are constructible; they can be called using the new keyword.

                However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be
                used as constructor functions. <br><br>
                5) No duplicate named parameters <br>
                Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.

                However, We can use duplicate named parameters for regular function in non-strict mode.

            <h1>(3.) Why should we use <span class="text-primary">Template String</span> ?? </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                A string template expression is a new kind of expression in the Java language. A string template
                expression can perform string interpolation, but is also "programmable" in a way that helps developers
                to compose strings safely and efficiently.
                Template literals (template strings) allow you to use strings or embedded expressions in the form of a
                string. They are enclosed in backticks `` . For example, const name = 'Jack'; console.
